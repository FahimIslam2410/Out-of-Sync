# Out of Sync

Out of Sync is a multiplayer game I made using the Godot game engine, inspired by the fun of "Out the Loop." Originally, I planned to release it on Android and iOS, but I ran into problems exporting it to Android, so development is on hold for now.

## Development Approach

I followed a phased development approach aimed at delivering core functionality before enhancing the user interface and aesthetics:

1. **Basic Functionality**: I focused initially on implementing fundamental gameplay mechanics and user interface elements. This approach ensured that the game's core features were functional and operational.

2. **UI and Aesthetics**: In subsequent phases of development, I prioritized refining the user interface and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the game. By iterating on the existing foundation, my aim was to create a more immersive and engaging experience for players.

## How to Play

### Title Screen
- Start the game by tapping "Play."
- Learn how to play in the "How to Play" section.
- Adjust settings like the discussion timer in "Options."
- Exit the game gracefully using the quit option.

## What I Learned

Making Out of Sync taught me a lot:

- I learned how to build things that I can reuse in different parts of the game.
- I figured out how to add and remove things dynamically to make the game more flexible.
- I got better at designing menus and screens that are easy to use.
- I found out how to keep track of important information using global scripts.

## Future Improvements

I have some ideas for how to make Out of Sync even better:

- I want to fix the problems with exporting to Android so everyone can play.
- I'm going to make the game look nicer with better graphics and animations.
- I might add more features, like letting people play online with friends or adding different game modes.

## Known Issues

- I'm having trouble exporting to Android because of some technical stuff. I'll need to figure that out before I can continue working on the game.

I've put development on hold for now, but I've learned a lot from making Out of Sync, and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.
