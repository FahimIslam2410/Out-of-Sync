# Out of Sync

Out of Sync, a game crafted using the Godot game engine, draws inspiration from the engaging dynamics of "Out the Loop" playing a multiplayer game with one phone being passed. Initially envisioned for Android and iOS platforms, development has been halted due to challenges encountered with exporting to the Android platform.

Certainly, here's how you can integrate that approach into the README:

## Development Approach

Out of Sync follows a phased development approach aimed at delivering core functionality before enhancing the user interface and aesthetics:

1. **Basic Functionality**: The initial focus of development centered around implementing fundamental gameplay mechanics and user interface elements. This approach ensures that the game's core features are functional and operational.

2. **UI and Aesthetics**: Subsequent phases of development prioritize refining the user interface and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the game. By iterating on the existing foundation, the aim is to create a more immersive and engaging experience for players.

By adopting this iterative development model, Out of Sync aims to strike a balance between functionality and aesthetics, ultimately delivering a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. **Title Screen**:
   - Initiate gameplay by selecting the "Play" option.
   - Familiarize yourself with game rules via the "How to Play" feature.
   - Tailor settings, including discussion timer duration, using the "Options" menu.
   - Opt out gracefully with the "Quit" functionality.

2. **Get Player Name**:
   - Input player names within the designated fields.
   - Seamlessly manage player roster with the intuitive addition and removal buttons.
   - Advance to subsequent stages upon enlisting four players.

3. **Category Selection**:
   - Exercise discretion in choosing question categories to suit player preferences.
   - Validate functionality through the provided timer demonstration.

## What I learnt:

The development journey of Out of Sync has been enriching, yielding invaluable insights:

- Streamlined creation of reusable components to optimize scene construction.
- Implementation of dynamic child component management for enhanced flexibility.
- Crafting intuitive UI layouts conducive to seamless navigation.
- Leveraging global scripts for efficient data storage and management.

## Future Improvements

- Resolve compatibility hurdles to enable seamless Android deployment.
- Elevate aesthetic appeal through refined visual elements and animations.
- Expand gameplay features, potentially incorporating multiplayer online support or diverse game modes.

## Known Issues

- While the core concept of Out of Sync remains promising, Android export may encounter compatibility issues with build tools, impeding successful deployment. As a result, further development has been paused until these challenges can be resolved. ("Could not find version of build tools that matches Target SDK, using 28.0.2")
